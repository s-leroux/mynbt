Snippets showing how to achieve practical tasks with 
the `mynbt` library

Code samples  are assumed to be run from the root nbt forlder:

   python3 snippets/copy-chunk.py

To reduce boilerplate code and keep examples straight to
the point, snippets do not handle command line arguments
nor any other form of configuration.

All changes should be done by modifying the code.  Check the
individual source files for more infos
